This will concern probably only a handful of people, if even that, but here is a working nix package declaration for the 2024 tax declaration software of the canton of lucerne.

Currently only a simple default.nix declaration, if someone would like me to add a flake.nix let me know or send a pull request. As I'm currently not using flakes i didn't include one.

Happy for any feedback, cheers!
